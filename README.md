# reactive-kube

reactive-kube is a revolutionary library that allows you to describe Kubernetes infrastructure using headless React components. This approach provides a familiar and intuitive way for developers to define and manage their Kubernetes resources.

## Features

- **React-based**: Leverage the power and flexibility of React to define your Kubernetes infrastructure
- **Headless Components**: Use custom or default view components to visualize your infrastructure
- **Real-time Updates**: Subscribe to Kubernetes cluster updates and apply new configurations seamlessly
- **Extensible**: Easily create custom components for any Kubernetes resource

## Installation

```bash
npm install reactive-kube
```

## Quick Start

```tsx
import { Cluster, Namespace, Pod } from 'reactive-kube';

const MyInfrastructure = () => (
  <Cluster name="docker-desktop" user="docker-desktop">
    <Namespace name="default">
      <Pod
        name="my-pod"
        containers={[{ image: "ubuntu:latest" }]}
        volumes={[/* ... */]}
      />
    </Namespace>
  </Cluster>
);
```
